DRIFT Search
============
Source : https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/query/drift_search/

GraphRAG is a technique that uses large language models (LLMs) to create knowledge graphs and summaries from unstructured text documents and leverages them to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) operations on private datasets. It offers comprehensive global overviews of large, private troves of unstructured text documents while also enabling exploration of detailed, localized information. By using LLMs to create comprehensive knowledge graphs that connect and describe entities and relationships contained in those documents, GraphRAG leverages semantic structuring of the data to generate responses to a wide variety of complex user queries.

DRIFT search (Dynamic Reasoning and Inference with Flexible Traversal) builds upon Microsoftâ€™s GraphRAG technique, combining characteristics of both global and local search to generate detailed responses in a method that balances computational costs with quality outcomes using our drift search method.
