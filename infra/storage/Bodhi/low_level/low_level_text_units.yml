  ## Graphs


  At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior
  of your agents using three key components:


  1. [`State`](#state): A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot
  of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a `TypedDict` or
  Pydantic `BaseModel`.


  2. [`Nodes`](#nodes): Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They
  receive the current `State` as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and
  return an updated `State`.


  3. [`Edges`](#edges): Python functions that determine which `Node` to execute next
  based on the current `State`. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.
  By composing `Nodes` and `Edges`, you can create complex, looping workflows that
  evolve the `State` over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages
  that `State`. To emphasize: `Nodes` and `Edges` are nothing more than Python functions
  - they can contain an LLM or just good ol'' Python code. In short: _nodes do the
  work. edges tell what to do next_. LangGraph''s underlying graph algorithm uses
  [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) to define a general
  program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more
  edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass
  the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired
  by Google''s [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pregel-a-system-for-large-scale-graph-processing/)
  system, the program proceeds in discrete "super-steps. "


  A super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that
  run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially
  belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin
  in an `inactive` state. A node becomes `active` when it receives a new message (state)
  on any of its incoming edges (or "channels"). The active node then runs its function
  and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming
  messages vote to `halt` by marking themselves as `inactive`. The graph execution
  terminates when all nodes are `inactive` and no messages are in transit.


  ### StateGraph


  The `StateGraph` class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by
  a user defined `State` object.


  ### MessageGraph


  The `MessageGraph` class is a special type of graph. The `State` of a `MessageGraph`
  is ONLY a list of messages. This class is rarely used except for chatbots, as most
  applications require the `State` to be more complex than a list of messages.'
- '### Compiling your graph


  To build your graph, you first define the [state](#state), you then add [nodes](#nodes)
  and [edges](#edges), and then you compile it.What exactly is compiling your graph
  and why is it needed? Compiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic
  checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where
  you can specify runtime args like [checkpointers](./persistence.md) and [breakpoints](#breakpoints).
  You compile your graph by just calling the `.compile` method:


  ```python

  graph = graph_builder.compile(...)

  ```


  You **MUST** compile your graph before you can use it. ## State The first thing
  you do when you define a graph is define the `State` of the graph. The `State` consists
  of the [schema of the graph](#schema) as well as [`reducer` functions](#reducers)
  which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the `State` will
  be the input schema to all `Nodes` and `Edges` in the graph, and can be either a
  `TypedDict` or a `Pydantic` model. All `Nodes` will emit updates to the `State`
  which are then applied using the specified `reducer` function.


  ### Schema


  The main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using `TypedDict`.
  However, we also support [using a Pydantic BaseModel](../how-tos/state-model.ipynb)
  as your graph state to add **default values** and additional data validation. By
  default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change
  this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful
  when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output.
  See the [notebook here](../how-tos/input_output_schema.ipynb) for how to use.


  #### Multiple schemas


  Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they
  will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want
  more control over this:


  - Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph''s input
  / output. - We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph.
  The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key. It is
  possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal
  node communication. We can simply define a private schema, `PrivateState`. See [this
  notebook](../how-tos/pass_private_state.ipynb) for more detail. It is also possible
  to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define
  an "internal" schema that contains _all_ keys relevant to graph operations.'
- "But, we also define `input` and `output` schemas that are sub-sets of the \"internal\"\
  \ schema to constrain the input and output of the graph.See [this notebook](../how-tos/input_output_schema.ipynb)\
  \ for more detail. Let's look at an example:\n\n```python\nclass InputState(TypedDict):\n\
  \    user_input: str\n\nclass OutputState(TypedDict):\n    graph_output: str\n\n\
  class OverallState(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n    user_input: str\n    graph_output:\
  \ str\n\nclass PrivateState(TypedDict):\n    bar: str\n\ndef node_1(state: InputState)\
  \ -> OverallState:\n    # Write to OverallState\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"user_input\"\
  ] + \" name\"}\n\ndef node_2(state: OverallState) -> PrivateState:\n    # Read from\
  \ OverallState, write to PrivateState\n    return {\"bar\": state[\"foo\"] + \"\
  \ is\"}\n\ndef node_3(state: PrivateState) -> OutputState:\n    # Read from PrivateState,\
  \ write to OutputState\n    return {\"graph_output\": state[\"bar\"] + \" Lance\"\
  }\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState,input=InputState,output=OutputState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"\
  node_1\", node_1)\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_2\", node_2) builder.add_node(\"node_3\"\
  , node_3)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_1\", \"\
  node_2\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_2\", \"node_3\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_3\"\
  , END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile()\ngraph.invoke({\"user_input\":\"My\"})\n{'graph_output':\
  \ 'My name is Lance'}\n```\n\nThere are two subtle and important points to note\
  \ here:\n\n1. We pass `state: InputState` as the input schema to `node_1`. But,\
  \ we write out to `foo`, a channel in `OverallState`. How can we write out to a\
  \ state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node\
  \ _can write to any state channel in the graph state._ The graph state is the union\
  \ of of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes `OverallState`\
  \ and the filters `InputState` and `OutputState`. 2. We initialize the graph with\
  \ `StateGraph(OverallState,input=InputState,output=OutputState)`. So, how can we\
  \ write to `PrivateState` in `node_2`? How does the graph gain access to this schema\
  \ if it was not passed in the `StateGraph` initialization? We can do this because\
  \ _nodes can also declare additional state channels_ as long as the state schema\
  \ definition exists. In this case, the `PrivateState` schema is defined, so we can\
  \ add `bar` as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.\n\n### Reducers\n\
  \nReducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the `State`.\
  \ Each key in the `State` has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer\
  \ function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key\
  \ should override it."
- "There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of\
  \ reducer:\n\n#### Default Reducer\n\nThese two examples show how to use the default\
  \ reducer:\n\n**Example A:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\
  \nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: list[str]\n```\n\nIn this example,\
  \ no reducer functions are specified for any key.Let's assume the input to the graph\
  \ is `{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. Let's then assume the first `Node` returns\
  \ `{\"foo\": 2}`. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the `Node`\
  \ does not need to return the whole `State` schema - just an update. After applying\
  \ this update, the `State` would then be `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. If the\
  \ second node returns `{\"bar\": [\"bye\"]}` then the `State` would then be `{\"\
  foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"bye\"]}`\n\n**Example B:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import\
  \ Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\nfrom operator import add\n\
  \nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: int\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\n```\n\
  \nIn this example, we've used the `Annotated` type to specify a reducer function\
  \ (`operator.add`) for the second key (`bar`). Note that the first key remains unchanged.\
  \ Let's assume the input to the graph is `{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. Let's\
  \ then assume the first `Node` returns `{\"foo\": 2}`. This is treated as an update\
  \ to the state. Notice that the `Node` does not need to return the whole `State`\
  \ schema - just an update. After applying this update, the `State` would then be\
  \ `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}`. If the second node returns `{\"bar\": [\"bye\"\
  ]}` then the `State` would then be `{\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\", \"bye\"]}`. Notice\
  \ here that the `bar` key is updated by adding the two lists together. ### Working\
  \ with Messages in Graph State\n\n#### Why use messages? Most modern LLM providers\
  \ have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain's\
  \ [`ChatModel`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#chat-models) in particular\
  \ accepts a list of `Message` objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety\
  \ of forms such as `HumanMessage` (user input) or `AIMessage` (LLM response)."
- "To read more about what message objects are, please refer to [this](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#messages)\
  \ conceptual guide.\n\n#### Using Messages in your Graph\n\nIn many cases, it is\
  \ helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph\
  \ state.To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list\
  \ of `Message` objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see `messages` key\
  \ in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how\
  \ to update the list of `Message` objects in the state with each state update (for\
  \ example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state\
  \ update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value.\
  \ If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use `operator.add`\
  \ as a reducer. However, you might also want to manually update messages in your\
  \ graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use `operator.add`, the manual\
  \ state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of\
  \ messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer\
  \ that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated.\
  \ To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt `add_messages` function. For brand new\
  \ messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the\
  \ updates for existing messages correctly.\n\n#### Serialization\n\nIn addition\
  \ to keeping track of message IDs, the `add_messages` function will also try to\
  \ deserialize messages into LangChain `Message` objects whenever a state update\
  \ is received on the `messages` channel. See more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization\
  \ [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/serialization/). This allows sending\
  \ graph inputs / state updates in the following format:\n\n```python\n# this is\
  \ supported\n{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"message\")]}\n\n# and this is\
  \ also supported\n{\"messages\": [{\"type\": \"human\", \"content\": \"message\"\
  }]}\n```\n\nSince the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain `Messages`\
  \ when using `add_messages`, you should use dot notation to access message attributes,\
  \ like `state[\"messages\"][-1].content`. Below is an example of a graph that uses\
  \ `add_messages` as it's reducer function. ```python\nfrom langchain_core.messages\
  \ import AnyMessage\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\nfrom typing\
  \ import Annotated\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass GraphState(TypedDict):\n\
  \    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\n```\n\n#### MessagesState\n\
  \nSince having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt\
  \ state called `MessagesState` which makes it easy to use messages. `MessagesState`\
  \ is defined with a single `messages` key which is a list of `AnyMessage` objects\
  \ and uses the `add_messages` reducer."
- "Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass\
  \ this state and add more fields, like:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import\
  \ MessagesState\n\nclass State(MessagesState):\n    documents: list[str]\n```\n\n\
  ## Nodes\n\nIn LangGraph, nodes are typically python functions (sync or async) where\
  \ the **first** positional argument is the [state](#state), and (optionally), the\
  \ **second** positional argument is a \"config\", containing optional [configurable\
  \ parameters](#configuration) (such as a `thread_id`).Similar to `NetworkX`, you\
  \ add these nodes to a graph using the [add_node][langgraph.graph. StateGraph.add_node]\
  \ method:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\nfrom\
  \ langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(dict)\n\n\ndef my_node(state:\
  \ dict, config: RunnableConfig):\n    print(\"In node: \", config[\"configurable\"\
  ][\"user_id\"])\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state['input']}!\"}\n\n\n#\
  \ The second argument is optional\ndef my_other_node(state: dict):\n    return state\n\
  \n\nbuilder.add_node(\"my_node\", my_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"other_node\", my_other_node)\n\
  ...\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, functions are converted to [RunnableLambda's](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.\
  \ RunnableLambda.html#langchain_core.runnables.base. RunnableLambda), which add\
  \ batch and async support to your function, along with native tracing and debugging.\
  \ If you add a node to graph without specifying a name, it will be given a default\
  \ name equivalent to the function name. ```python\nbuilder.add_node(my_node) # You\
  \ can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `\"my_node\"`\n```\n\
  \n### `START` Node\n\nThe `START` Node is a special node that represents the node\
  \ sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to\
  \ determine which nodes should be called first. ```python\nfrom langgraph.graph\
  \ import START\n\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\n```\n\n### `END` Node\n\nThe\
  \ `END` Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced\
  \ when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done. ```\n\
  from langgraph.graph import END\n\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", END)\n```\n\n## Edges\n\
  \nEdges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is\
  \ a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each\
  \ other. There are a few key types of edges:\n\n- Normal Edges: Go directly from\
  \ one node to the next.\n- Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which\
  \ node(s) to go to next. - Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input\
  \ arrives. - Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s)\
  \ to call first when user input arrives. A node can have MULTIPLE outgoing edges."
- "If a node has multiple out-going edges, **all** of those destination nodes will\
  \ be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n\n### Normal EdgesIf\
  \ you **always** want to go from node A to node B, you can use the [add_edge][langgraph.graph.\
  \ StateGraph.add_edge] method directly. ```python\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"\
  node_b\")\n```\n\n### Conditional Edges\n\nIf you want to **optionally** route to\
  \ 1 or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the [add_conditional_edges][langgraph.graph.\
  \ StateGraph.add_conditional_edges] method. This method accepts the name of a node\
  \ and a \"routing function\" to call after that node is executed:\n\n```python\n\
  graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function)\n```\n\nSimilar to nodes,\
  \ the `routing_function` accept the current `state` of the graph and return a value.\
  \ By default, the return value `routing_function` is used as the name of the node\
  \ (or a list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in\
  \ parallel as a part of the next superstep. You can optionally provide a dictionary\
  \ that maps the `routing_function`'s output to the name of the next node. ```python\n\
  graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False:\
  \ \"node_c\"})\n```\n\n!!! tip\n    Use [`Command`](#command) instead of conditional\
  \ edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function.\n\
  \n### Entry Point The entry point is the first node(s) that are run when the graph\
  \ starts. You can use the [`add_edge`][langgraph.graph. StateGraph.add_edge] method\
  \ from the virtual [`START`][langgraph.constants.START] node to the first node to\
  \ execute to specify where to enter the graph. ```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import\
  \ START\n\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\n```\n\n### Conditional Entry Point\n\
  \nA conditional entry point lets you start at different nodes depending on custom\
  \ logic. You can use [`add_conditional_edges`][langgraph.graph.StateGraph.add_conditional_edges]\
  \ from the virtual [`START`][langgraph.constants. START] node to accomplish this.\
  \ ```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import START\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START,\
  \ routing_function)\n```\n\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the\
  \ `routing_function`'s output to the name of the next node. ```python\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START,\
  \ routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\n```\n\n## `Send`\n\n\
  By default, `Nodes` and `Edges` are defined ahead of time and operate on the same\
  \ shared state. However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known\
  \ ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of `State` to exist at the\
  \ same time. A common of example of this is with `map-reduce` design patterns."
- "In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may\
  \ want to apply some other node to all those objects.The number of objects may be\
  \ unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input\
  \ `State` to the downstream `Node` should be different (one for each generated object).\
  \ To support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning [`Send`][langgraph.types.\
  \ Send] objects from conditional edges. `Send` takes two arguments: first is the\
  \ name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node. ```python\ndef\
  \ continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):\n    return [Send(\"generate_joke\", {\"\
  subject\": s}) for s in state['subjects']]\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\"\
  , continue_to_jokes)\n```\n\n## `Command`\n\nIt can be useful to combine control\
  \ flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform\
  \ state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph\
  \ provides a way to do so by returning a [`Command`][langgraph.types. Command] object\
  \ from node functions:\n\n```python\ndef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"\
  my_other_node\"]]:\n    return Command(\n        # state update\n        update={\"\
  foo\": \"bar\"},\n        # control flow\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\n    )\n\
  ```\n\nWith `Command` you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical\
  \ to [conditional edges](#conditional-edges)):\n\n```python\ndef my_node(state:\
  \ State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n    if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\"\
  :\n        return Command(update={\"foo\": \"baz\"}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\n```\n\
  \n!!! important\n\n    When returning `Command` in your node functions, you must\
  \ add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to,\
  \ e.g. `Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]`. This is necessary for the graph rendering\
  \ and tells LangGraph that `my_node` can navigate to `my_other_node`. Check out\
  \ this [how-to guide](../how-tos/command.ipynb) for an end-to-end example of how\
  \ to use `Command`. ### When should I use Command instead of conditional edges?\
  \ Use `Command` when you need to **both** update the graph state **and** route to\
  \ a different node. For example, when implementing [multi-agent handoffs](./multi_agent.md#handoffs)\
  \ where it's important to route to a different agent and pass some information to\
  \ that agent. Use [conditional edges](#conditional-edges) to route between nodes\
  \ conditionally without updating the state. ### Using inside tools\n\nA common use\
  \ case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support\
  \ application you might want to look up customer information based on their account\
  \ number or ID in the beginning of the conversation."
- "To update the graph state from the tool, you can return `Command(update={\"my_custom_key\"\
  : \"foo\", \"messages\": [...]})` from the tool:\n\n```python\n@tool\ndef lookup_user_info(tool_call_id:Annotated[str,\
  \ InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):\n    \"\"\"Use this to look up user\
  \ information to better assist them with their questions.\" \"\"\n    user_info\
  \ = get_user_info(config.get(\"configurable\", {}).get(\"user_id\"))\n    return\
  \ Command(\n        update={\n            # update the state keys\n            \"\
  user_info\": user_info,\n            # update the message history\n            \"\
  messages\": [ToolMessage(\"Successfully looked up user information\", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]\n\
  \        }\n    )\n```\n\n!!! important\n    You MUST include `messages` (or any\
  \ state key used for the message history) in `Command.update` when returning `Command`\
  \ from a tool and the list of messages in `messages` MUST contain a `ToolMessage`.\
  \ This is necessary for the resulting message history to be valid (LLM providers\
  \ require AI messages with tool calls to be followed by the tool result messages).\
  \ If you are using tools that update state via `Command`, we recommend using prebuilt\
  \ [`ToolNode`][langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node. ToolNode] which automatically handles\
  \ tools returning `Command` objects and propagates them to the graph state. If you're\
  \ writing a custom node that calls tools, you would need to manually propagate `Command`\
  \ objects returned by the tools as the update from node. ### Human-in-the-loop\n\
  \n`Command` is an important part of human-in-the-loop workflows: when using `interrupt()`\
  \ to collect user input, `Command` is then used to supply the input and resume execution\
  \ via `Command(resume=\"User input\")`. Check out [this conceptual guide](./human_in_the_loop.md)\
  \ for more information.\n\n## Persistence\n\nLangGraph provides built-in persistence\
  \ for your agent's state using [checkpointers][langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver].\
  \ Checkpointers save snapshots of the graph state at every superstep, allowing resumption\
  \ at any time. This enables features like human-in-the-loop interactions, memory\
  \ management, and fault-tolerance. You can even directly manipulate a graph's state\
  \ after its execution using the\nappropriate `get` and `update` methods. For more\
  \ details, see the [persistence conceptual guide](./persistence.md).\n\n## Threads\n\
  \nThreads in LangGraph represent individual sessions or conversations between your\
  \ graph and a user. When using checkpointing, turns in a single conversation (and\
  \ even steps within a single graph execution) are organized by a unique thread ID.\n\
  \n## Storage\n\nLangGraph provides built-in document storage through the [BaseStore][langgraph.store.base.\
  \ BaseStore] interface. Unlike checkpointers, which save state by thread ID, stores\
  \ use custom namespaces for organizing data. This enables cross-thread persistence,\
  \ allowing agents to maintain long-term memories, learn from past interactions,\
  \ and accumulate knowledge over time."
- "Common use cases include storing user profiles, building knowledge bases, and managing\
  \ global preferences across all threads.\n\n## Graph Migrations\n\nLangGraph can\
  \ easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when\
  \ using a checkpointer to track state.\n\n-For threads at the end of the graph (i.e.\
  \ not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes\
  \ and edges, remove, add, rename, etc)\n- For threads currently interrupted, we\
  \ support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread\
  \ could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) -- if this is a blocker\
  \ please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\n- For modifying state, we\
  \ have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys\n\
  - State keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads\n- State\
  \ keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads\
  \ with state from before the change -- if this is a blocker please reach out and\
  \ we can prioritize a solution.\n\n## Configuration\n\nWhen creating a graph, you\
  \ can also mark that certain parts of the graph are configurable. This is commonly\
  \ done to enable easily switching between models or system prompts. This allows\
  \ you to create a single \"cognitive architecture\" (the graph) but have multiple\
  \ different instance of it. You can optionally specify a `config_schema` when creating\
  \ a graph. ```python\nclass ConfigSchema(TypedDict):\n    llm: str\n\ngraph = StateGraph(State,\
  \ config_schema=ConfigSchema)\n```\n\nYou can then pass this configuration into\
  \ the graph using the `configurable` config field. ```python\nconfig = {\"configurable\"\
  : {\"llm\": \"anthropic\"}}\n\ngraph.invoke(inputs, config=config)\n```\n\nYou can\
  \ then access and use this configuration inside a node:\n\n```python\ndef node_a(state,\
  \ config):\n    llm_type = config.get(\"configurable\", {}).get(\"llm\", \"openai\"\
  ) llm = get_llm(llm_type)\n    ... ```\n\nSee [this guide](../how-tos/configuration.ipynb)\
  \ for a full breakdown on configuration.\n\n### Recursion Limit\n\nThe recursion\
  \ limit sets the maximum number of [super-steps](#graphs) the graph can execute\
  \ during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise `GraphRecursionError`.\
  \ By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any\
  \ graph at runtime, and is passed to `.invoke`/`.stream` via the config dictionary.\
  \ Importantly, `recursion_limit` is a standalone `config` key and should not be\
  \ passed inside the `configurable` key as all other user-defined configuration."
- "See the example below:\n\n```python\ngraph.invoke(inputs, config={\"recursion_limit\"\
  : 5, \"configurable\":{\"llm\": \"anthropic\"}})\n```\n\nRead [this how-to](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/recursion-limit/)\
  \ to learn more about how the recursion limit works.\n\n## `interrupt`\n\nUse the\
  \ [interrupt](../reference/types.md/#langgraph.types.interrupt) function to **pause**\
  \ the graph at specific points to collect user input.The `interrupt` function surfaces\
  \ interrupt information to the client, allowing the developer to collect user input,\
  \ validate the graph state, or make decisions before resuming execution. ```python\n\
  from langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef human_approval_node(state: State):\n\
  \    ... answer = interrupt(\n        # This value will be sent to the client. #\
  \ It can be any JSON serializable value. {\"question\": \"is it ok to continue?\"\
  },\n    )\n    ...\n```\n\nResuming the graph is done by passing a [`Command`](#command)\
  \ object to the graph with the `resume` key set to the value returned by the `interrupt`\
  \ function. Read more about how the `interrupt` is used for **human-in-the-loop**\
  \ workflows in the [Human-in-the-loop conceptual guide](./human_in_the_loop.md).\n\
  \n## Breakpoints\n\nBreakpoints pause graph execution at specific points and enable\
  \ stepping through execution step by step. Breakpoints are powered by LangGraph's\
  \ [**persistence layer**](./persistence.md), which saves the state after each graph\
  \ step. Breakpoints can also be used to enable [**human-in-the-loop**](./human_in_the_loop.md)\
  \ workflows, though we recommend using the [`interrupt` function](#interrupt-function)\
  \ for this purpose. Read more about breakpoints in the [Breakpoints conceptual guide](./breakpoints.md).\n\
  \n## Subgraphs\n\nA subgraph is a [graph](#graphs) that is used as a [node](#nodes)\
  \ in another graph. This is nothing more than the age-old concept of encapsulation,\
  \ applied to LangGraph. Some reasons for using subgraphs are:\n\n- building [multi-agent\
  \ systems](./multi_agent.md)\n\n- when you want to reuse a set of nodes in multiple\
  \ graphs, which maybe share some state, you can define them once in a subgraph and\
  \ then use them in multiple parent graphs\n\n- when you want different teams to\
  \ work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as\
  \ a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas)\
  \ is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the\
  \ subgraph"
- "There are two ways to add subgraphs to a parent graph:\n\n- add a node with the\
  \ compiled subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph share\
  \ state keys and you don't need to transform state on the way in or out\n\n```python\n\
  builder.add_node(\"subgraph\", subgraph_builder.compile())\n```\n\n- add a node\
  \ with a function that invokes the subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph\
  \ and the subgraph have different state schemas and you need to transform state\
  \ before or after calling the subgraph\n\n```python\nsubgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()\n\
  \ndef call_subgraph(state: State):\n    return subgraph.invoke({\"subgraph_key\"\
  : state[\"parent_key\"]})builder.add_node(\"subgraph\", call_subgraph)\n```\n\n\
  Let's take a look at examples for each. ### As a compiled graph\n\nThe simplest\
  \ way to create subgraph nodes is by using a [compiled subgraph](#compiling-your-graph)\
  \ directly. When doing so, it is **important** that the parent graph and the subgraph\
  \ [state schemas](#state) share at least one key which they can use to communicate.\
  \ If your graph and subgraph do not share any keys, you should use write a function\
  \ [invoking the subgraph](#as-a-function) instead.\n\n!!! Note\n    If you pass\
  \ extra keys to the subgraph node (i.e., in addition to the shared keys), they will\
  \ be ignored by the subgraph node. Similarly, if you return extra keys from the\
  \ subgraph, they will be ignored by the parent graph. ```python\nfrom langgraph.graph\
  \ import StateGraph\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n \
  \   foo: str\n\nclass SubgraphState(TypedDict):\n    foo: str  # note that this\
  \ key is shared with the parent graph state\n    bar: str\n\n# Define subgraph\n\
  def subgraph_node(state: SubgraphState):\n    # note that this subgraph node can\
  \ communicate with the parent graph via the shared \"foo\" key\n    return {\"foo\"\
  : state[\"foo\"] + \"bar\"} subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)\nsubgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node)\n\
  ... subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()\n\n# Define parent graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n\
  builder.add_node(\"subgraph\", subgraph)\n...\ngraph = builder.compile()\n```\n\n\
  ### As a function\n\nYou might want to define a subgraph with a completely different\
  \ schema. In this case, you can create a node function that invokes the subgraph.\
  \ This function will need to [transform](../how-tos/subgraph-transform-state.ipynb)\
  \ the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and\
  \ transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update\
  \ from the node."
- "```python\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    foo: str\n\nclass SubgraphState(TypedDict):\n\
  \    # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state\n   \
  \ bar: str\n    baz: str\n\n# Define subgraph\ndef subgraph_node(state: SubgraphState):\n\
  \    return {\"bar\": state[\"bar\"] + \"baz\"}\n\nsubgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)\n\
  subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node)\n...\nsubgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()\n\
  \n#Define parent graph\ndef node(state: State):\n    # transform the state to the\
  \ subgraph state\n    response = subgraph.invoke({\"bar\": state[\"foo\"]})\n  \
  \  # transform response back to the parent state\n    return {\"foo\": response[\"\
  bar\"]}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\n# note that we are using `node` function\
  \ instead of a compiled subgraph\nbuilder.add_node(node)\n...\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\
  ```\n\n## Visualization\n\nIt's often nice to be able to visualize graphs, especially\
  \ as they get more complex. LangGraph comes with several built-in ways to visualize\
  \ graphs. See [this how-to guide](../how-tos/visualization.ipynb) for more info.\n\
  \n## Streaming\n\nLangGraph is built with first class support for streaming, including\
  \ streaming updates from graph nodes during the execution, streaming tokens from\
  \ LLM calls and more. See this [conceptual guide](./streaming.md) for more information."
