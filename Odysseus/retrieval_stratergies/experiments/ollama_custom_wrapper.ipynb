      "Global Search Response: A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that models real-world entities and their interrelationships. It consists of nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) to create a network that encodes data in a way that allows for semantic queries and reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of knowledge graphs include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Entities**: These are the basic units or objects, such as people, places, things, or concepts.\n",
      "2. **Relationships**: These define how entities are connected, indicating various types of interactions or associations between them.\n",
      "3. **Attributes/Properties**: Additional information about entities and relationships can be stored to enrich the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge graphs enable sophisticated data integration, retrieval, and analysis by allowing machines to understand context, semantics, and concepts in a manner similar to human understanding. They are often powered by technologies like RDF (Resource Description Framework), SPARQL (a query language for databases), and ontologies which provide formal structures for categorizing and linking information.\n",

      "Applications of knowledge graphs span various domains such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Search Engines**: Enhancing search results with contextually relevant information.\n",
      "- **Personal Assistants**: Providing more accurate and meaningful responses to user queries.\n",
      "- **Recommendation Systems**: Improving suggestions by understanding user preferences and connections between different types of content.\n",
      "- **Enterprise Solutions**: Facilitating better decision-making through unified views of disparate data sources.\n",
